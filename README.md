# Parkinson's Disease Detection Tool using SVM

## Overview

This project aims to build a Parkinson's Disease Detection tool using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The tool utilizes a dataset from Kaggle ([Parkinsons Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/nidaguler/parkinsons-data-set)) for training and testing the SVM model.

## Methodology

### Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outlier detection. They are effective for high-dimensional spaces and remain valid when the number of measurements is greater than the number of samples.

## Project Structure

- **1. Data Preprocessing:**
  - Load the dataset from Kaggle.
  - Explore and clean the data.
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

- **2. Feature Selection:**
  - Identify relevant features contributing to Parkinson's disease prediction.
  - Use feature selection techniques.

- **3. Feature Scaling:**
  - Standardize or normalize features to ensure uniform scale.

- **4. Model Building:**
  - Choose the SVM kernel (linear, polynomial, RBF, etc.).
  - Train the SVM model on the training dataset.
  - Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.

- **5. Model Evaluation:**
  - Evaluate the model on the testing dataset.
  - Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
  - Implement cross-validation techniques.

- **6. Interpretation:**
  - Analyze decision boundaries and support vectors.
  - Interpret predictions in the context of Parkinson's disease diagnosis.

- **7. Deployment:**
  - Deploy the model for real-world predictions.
  - Consider packaging the model into a user-friendly application.
