        <h2><span style="color:red"><strong><u>Common Questions about Parkinson's:</u></strong> </span><br> <br>

            <span style="color:#fe9e0d">Q: What is Parkinson's disease?</span><br>
            First described by James Parkinson in the 1800s as "the shaking
            palsy,"
            Parkinson’s disease (PD) involves
            the progressive degeneration of nerve cells in the brainstem, particularly those that produce the
            neurotransmitter dopamine. A neurotransmitter is a chemical messenger that allows nerve cells to "talk"
            or
            send messages. When these cells degenerate, it causes a wide variety of symptoms, including loss of
            smooth
            and coordinated movement.<br><br>

            <span style="color:#fe9e0d"> Q: What are the symptoms of Parkinson's disease?</span><br>
            Parkinson's disease causes a number of motor symptoms, including balance and coordination issues, rigidity
            or stiffness of the limbs, slowness of movement, and tremor in the arms, legs, hands, or jaw. PD also
            involves non-motor symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, impaired sense of smell, and sleep disorders. The
            symptoms and severity of Parkinson’s disease vary from person to person. In addition, your symptoms may vary
            over time. Since these symptoms can appear slowly and may mimic other diseases, PD may be misdiagnosed or
            undiagnosed for many years.<br><br>

            <span style="color:#fe9e0d">Q: How do you diagnose Parkinson's disease?</span><br>
            There is no simple, single laboratory or blood test to diagnose Parkinson's disease. We begin the diagnostic
            process by taking a complete medical and family history and carefully observing any visible symptoms. We use
            blood tests, lab tests, or imaging studies together to rule out other diseases or conditions that may be
            causing symptoms.
            But with the advancements in AI and ML, we can use them to provide a fairly accurate diagnosis at a low
            cost.<br><br>

            <span style="color:#fe9e0d">Q: What causes Parkinson's disease?</span><br>
            We believe that Parkinson's disease is caused by a combination of factors, including genetics and
            environmental "triggers." While scientists have discovered specific genes and elements responsible for some
            types of Parkinson's, the cause of most cases remains unclear.<br><br>

            <span style="color:#fe9e0d">Q: Who is at risk for Parkinson's?</span><br>
            Your risk of developing Parkinson's disease increases with age, but it can affect younger people as well
            (called "young onset PD" or YOPD). Scientists have discovered that certain environmental factors (such as
            exposure to certain toxins or drugs) may result in the symptoms of PD, but in general, PD is caused by a
            combination of predisposing genetic factors and "triggering" events.<br><br>

            <span style="color:#fe9e0d"> Q: What are the treatment options for Parkinson's disease?</span><br>
            As of now, there is no cure for Parkinson's disease and no proven treatments to stop or slow its
            progression. However, there are a variety of therapies that can help. Treatment options include medication
            and surgery, as well as physical, occupational, and speech therapy.<br><br>

            <span style="color:#fe9e0d"> Q: How can I find others living with Parkinson's disease?</span><br>
            Support groups for people with Parkinson's disease and their caregivers are an important source of
            information and emotional comfort. There are many national and local advocacy and support organizations as
            well as activities at Mount Sinai and resources for people living with this condition.<br><br>

            <span style="color:red"> <strong><u>Misconceptions about Parkinson's</u></strong></span> <br> <br>

            <span style="color:#fe9e0d">1. Misconception: Only older adults get Parkinson's.</span> <br>
            - Clarification: While the risk increases with age, Parkinson's can affect people under 40, and young-onset
            Parkinson's exists. <br> <br>

            <span style="color:#fe9e0d">2. Misconception: Parkinson's is solely a movement disorder.</span> <br>
            - Clarification: Parkinson's can also involve non-motor symptoms like mood changes, sleep disturbances, and
            cognitive issues. <br> <br>

            <span style="color:#fe9e0d"> 3. Misconception: Parkinson's is always associated with tremors. </span><br>
            - Clarification: Tremors are common, but not all individuals with Parkinson's experience them; there are
            other motor symptoms like stiffness and slowness. <br> <br>

            <span style="color:#fe9e0d"> 4. Misconception: Parkinson's is always progressive and inevitably leads to
                severe disability.</span><br>
            - Clarification: Progression varies; some individuals experience slow progression, while others may have a
            more stable course. <br>
            <br>
            <span style="color:#fe9e0d"> 5. Misconception: Medication alone can cure Parkinson's. </span><br>
            - Clarification: Medication helps manage symptoms, but there is no cure. Various therapies and lifestyle
            changes also play crucial roles in management. <br> <br>

            <span style="color:#fe9e0d"> 6. Misconception: People with Parkinson's cannot lead an active life.</span>
            <br>
            - Clarification: Regular exercise and adaptive strategies can help individuals with Parkinson's lead active
            and fulfilling lives. <br>
            <br>
            <span style="color:#fe9e0d"> 7. Misconception: Parkinson's is always visible to others.</span> <br>
            - Clarification: Many symptoms are not visible externally, leading to misunderstandings about the
            individual's condition. <br> <br>

            <span style="color:#fe9e0d"> 8. Misconception: Parkinson's is the same for everyone.</span> <br>
            - Clarification: Parkinson's is highly individualized; symptoms, progression, and response to treatment can
            vary widely. <br>
            <br>
            <span style="color:#fe9e0d">9. Misconception: Only movement specialists can diagnose and treat
                Parkinson's.</span> <br>
            - Clarification: While neurologists often diagnose Parkinson's, various healthcare professionals contribute
            to its management, including physical therapists and occupational therapists. <br>
            <br>
            <span style="color:#fe9e0d"> 10. Misconception: Parkinson's affects only motor function.</span> <br>
            - Clarification: Non-motor symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, are also common in
            Parkinson's. <br> <br>
