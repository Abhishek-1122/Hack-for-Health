            <strong>Misconceptions about Parkinson's</strong> <br> <br>

            1. Misconception: Only older adults get Parkinson's. <br>
            - Clarification: While the risk increases with age, Parkinson's can affect people under 40, and young-onset
            Parkinson's exists. <br> <br>

            2. Misconception: Parkinson's is solely a movement disorder. <br>
            - Clarification: Parkinson's can also involve non-motor symptoms like mood changes, sleep disturbances, and
            cognitive issues. <br> <br>

            3. Misconception: Parkinson's is always associated with tremors. <br>
            - Clarification: Tremors are common, but not all individuals with Parkinson's experience them; there are
            other motor symptoms like stiffness and slowness. <br> <br>

            4. Misconception: Parkinson's is always progressive and inevitably leads to severe disability.
            - Clarification: Progression varies; some individuals experience slow progression, while others may have a
            more stable course. <br>
            <br>
            5. Misconception: Medication alone can cure Parkinson's. <br>
            - Clarification: Medication helps manage symptoms, but there is no cure. Various therapies and lifestyle
            changes also play crucial roles in management. <br> <br>

            6. Misconception: People with Parkinson's cannot lead an active life. <br>
            - Clarification: Regular exercise and adaptive strategies can help individuals with Parkinson's lead active
            and fulfilling lives. <br>
            <br>
            7. Misconception: Parkinson's is always visible to others. <br>
            - Clarification: Many symptoms are not visible externally, leading to misunderstandings about the
            individual's condition. <br> <br>

            8. Misconception: Parkinson's is the same for everyone. <br>
            - Clarification: Parkinson's is highly individualized; symptoms, progression, and response to treatment can
            vary widely. <br>
            <br>
            9. Misconception: Only movement specialists can diagnose and treat Parkinson's. <br>
            - Clarification: While neurologists often diagnose Parkinson's, various healthcare professionals contribute
            to its management, including physical therapists and occupational therapists. <br>
            <br>
            10. Misconception: Parkinson's affects only motor function. <br>
            - Clarification: Non-motor symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances, are also common in
            Parkinson's. <br> <br>
