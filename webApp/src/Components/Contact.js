          <br />
          While our AI-powered Parkinson's prediction tool aims to provide
          valuable insights, it is crucial to remember that it is not a
          substitute for professional medical advice. If you receive results
          indicating a potential risk of Parkinson's or any health concern, we
          strongly advise consulting with a qualified healthcare professional
          for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized guidance. Your health
          is our priority, and seeking a doctor's opinion ensures accurate
          diagnosis and appropriateÂ care."
